# Object-Detection

Object detection is a pivotal task in computer vision, enabling automated systems to identify and locate objects within images or videos. With advancements in deep learning, numerous state-of-the-art models have emerged, each excelling in accuracy, speed, or computational efficiency.

This project presents a comparative evaluation of six leading object detection algorithms:
Faster R-CNN
Mask R-CNN
RetinaNet
Keypoint R-CNN
YOLOv8
DETR (DEtection TRansformer)

Using the Microsoft COCO 2017 dataset and Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, these models were assessed on their ability to detect, localize, and classify objects under diverse conditions.

Introduction

Object detection has become essential in domains like autonomous driving, healthcare, robotics, and surveillance. While Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN dominate in accuracy, lightweight architectures like YOLOv8 are ideal for real-time use cases. Emerging models like DETR simplify pipelines using transformers.
This study provides a side-by-side analysis to guide practitioners in selecting the most suitable model for their application.
